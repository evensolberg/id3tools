# id3tools

This repository contains a set of tools for manipulating music files such as FLAC, MP3, MP4, APE and DSF.
See the individual directories for more information.

Please note that the code quality, especially in the `id3tag` tool isn't great. It's reasonably robust, but the design isn't overly clean. I'm not a software engineer.
