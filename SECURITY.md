# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I don't necessarily foresee any huge security shortcomings with this, since it's not really that kind of an application.
That said, the only "supported" version is whatever is the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot something that could be a problem, please create an issue and I will have a look ASAP (usually, the following weekend).
