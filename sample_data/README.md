# Sample Data

This directory contains example data files that you can use to get started with the `id3tools` toolset.

It also contains sample files for ideas to be implemented later, and for testing purposes. This includes work in progress, and other files that are not yet ready for release.

## Summary.json

This is a file meant to be generated by the `id3export` tool. It contains a summary of the music files in the current directory. It is a JSON file, and can be used to import the music files into a music library, maybe. Or just for bigger summary purposes later. Don't know yet. :-)
